In the app, the user should be able to see the location on the start page and the design should change depending on the weather. So when the weather is nice you should see a sun and when it rains you should see a cloud. The current weather report is shown in large, while the weather for the next few hours is shown in a small list below and that for the next few days above. In addition, the user can also discover the weather in other cities.
